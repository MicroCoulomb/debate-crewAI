## debate-crewAI

This project is a simple demonstration of using the **crewAI** agentic framework to run a structured debate between AI agents.

- **Goal**: Show how multiple agents can take different roles, argue for or against a topic, and collaboratively reach a final conclusion.
- **Approach**: Each agent is configured with its own role and tools, then orchestrated by crewAI to exchange arguments, critique each other, and refine their positions.
- **Usage**: Run the main entry point in `src/debate/main.py` to start a debate session with the configured agents and tasks.

This repository is meant as a minimal, easy-to-read example for experimenting with crewAI-based debating agents.
